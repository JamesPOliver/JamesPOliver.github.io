                <p class="lead">Hello there, and welcome to my little corner of the Internet. I'm James, although you probably figured that out given
                    that it's in the URL you used to get here. I am planning to use this site to host a few projects I intend to work on, as well as potentially
                    as a blog, because it gives me something to do amid the quarantine caused by <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic">the Coronavirus.</a>

                <h3>April 2nd 2020: Metahuman Project</h3>
                <p>This site was previously being used for what I'm now calling the Metahuman Project, which is an ongoing story about superheroes. That project is 
                    still going ahead, and I'm currently working on it. The original plan was to have it done for May. I'm not sure about that now because I've had other stuff
                    going on but now I have less of that. Anyway, here, have a quick logo I designed.
