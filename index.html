                <h1>Welcome</h1>
                <p>My name is James Oliver, and I'm a Computing Student who writes as a hobby.<br>
                    This site is going up because I thought maybe some people may enjoy reading my<br>
                    work rather than it just being written and then deleted when I need space on whatever<br>
                    device I wrote it on.</p>
                <p>Ever since Secondary School I've been a big fan of both the Arrowverse and the Marvel<br>
                   Cinematic Universe. Both are interconnected superhero franchises that has superheroes telling<br>
                   Their own stories, but when they need to they always come together to fight things that they never<br>
                   could alone.</p>
                <p>I've also noticed that there aren't many superheroes based in Ireland, where I live. This led me to write<br>
                   my own take on the genre, which I did several years ago. Back then my audience was one of my closest friends<br>
                   and he always told me that I should put my work out there. At one point, I had like twenty different heroes with<br>
                   their own stories and things.  I came across these recently, and decided to rewrite them.</p>
                <p>I hope you enjoy reading my work as much as I enjoy writing it.</p>

                <h2>Release</h2>
                <p>I plan to release my work in an episodic format, where each story consists of a set of episodes released over some<br>
                   interval that I will decide upon. I'm hoping to have the first story, Blizzard, ready to post by August.</p>
                <p>Yes. I did say "each story". I plan to release multiple stories which I hope people like.</p>
